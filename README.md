# Overview

A distributed platform to compose and compute information services, from a simple mathematical operation to rotate a solar cell on a spacecraft.<br/>
The distributed storage records worthful information for centuries as a D20-Blockchain with consensus mechanism of PoS.<br/>
The decentralized network on top of UDP/IP routed by distributed hash table provides peer-to-peer connections, which enable nodes to stablish end-to-end secure transmission tunnel, even though they use dynamic IP addresses behind ISPs, thanks to Hole-Punching mechanism.<br/>
The distributed environment enhances developers to implement and deploy their services coded with C/C++, Erlang/OTP, JAVA, Python, JavaScript and another supported programming languages and frameworks. It provides a laboratory of distributed systems for developers to design, implement, deploy and test services for example on a local IoT system. Furthermore, web application providers are able to serve their services using the advantages of distributed computing to reduce serving costs.<br/>
Free Flow of Information and Privacy are the CIS duties. Every body can provide, access and use information services on CIS anonymously.<br/>



# Cessor Information Systems, CIS

A distributed service-oriented and TX-based platform to perform particular processor of a cessor service, CS.<br />
CS is a distributed TX-based software-service documented and coded by supported programming languages.<br />
CIS provides cessor service transactions, CSTX as the I/O medium to communicate with other CS on CIS.<br />
CSTX is the structured service information object integrated with CIS.<br />

CS composes and computes CSTX using cessor service transaction protocol, CSTP.<br />
CSTP addressed CSTX to perform particular processor of a CS on CIS.<br />
CSTP maps a set of functions in a module of a package in a specific range on an allocated CS domain.<br />

# About

A fully decentralized open-source project under CIS license, CISL.<br/>

CIS project is maintained by Cessor Developer Committee, CDC, which is the structured organization of known or anonymous CIS developers have contributed to the project.
