# Cessor Information Systems, CIS

A distributed service-oriented and TX-based platform to perform particular processor of a cessor service, CS.<br />
CS is a distributed TX-based software-service documented and coded by supported programming languages.<br />
CIS provides cessor service transactions, CSTX as the I/O medium to communicate with other CS on CIS.<br />
CSTX is the structured service information object integrated with CIS.<br />

CS composes and computes CSTX using cessor service transaction protocol, CSTP.<br />
CSTP addressed CSTX to perform particular processor of a CS on CIS.<br />
CSTP maps a set of functions in a module of a package in a specific range on an allocated CS domain.<br />

It is a fully decentralized open-source project under CIS license, CISL.
Cessor project maintained by Cessor Developer Committee, CDC, which is the structured organisation of CIS developers have contributed to the project.
